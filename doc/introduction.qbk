[section Introduction]

Aboria implements a STL container of particles in 3D space. The library is header-only. The container supports random access of particles, as well as the normal STL algorithms. Neighbourhood searches are possible, using a bucket search method (uniform bucket spacing).

The motivation behind Aboria is to provide a useful library for implementing particle-based numerical algorithms, for example Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics or Molecular Dynamics. Each particle has a 3D position and user-defined data-package (for other variables such as velocity, density etc) and is optionally embedded within a cuboidal spatial domain (for neighbourhood searches) that can be periodic or not. Each particle also has its own random number generator that is seeded via its own unique id.
